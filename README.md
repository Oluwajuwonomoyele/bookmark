## Overview

The Bookmark landing page is a project i worked on with html, tailwindcss and vanilla javascript, vanilla javascript for the navigation bar mobile view toggle functionality, animated tab slider and also form vaildation.

## My process

This is my first project i worked on using tailwindcss. Using tailwincss it's always a mobile first workflow but i took the desktop first apprroach as i found it easier to implement. I used a week to complete this project, has to be one of my longest projects. I was a fun ride anyway.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework


### Continued development
For future and continued development, i'll do more projects with tailwindcss as it is a fun approach to styling your html page.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - This helped me as a guide in search for utility classes associated with tailwindcss
